# my-capstone-etl-project

## Project overview

Flights are considered a luxury good in economical concepts, meaning as your income increases you would increase your consumption of such transport method. When booking a flight, or a number of flights, it is important to consider several factors, including season, necessity, type of plane, ticket prices, and ultimately how long the flights take due to different routes airlines prefer to take as part of their journey. The analysis made from this project will show two visualisations of metrice compared of flight data between April to Ausugt of 2022. 

## Project Purpose

The aim of this project is to analyse flights around the world, while understanding parameters such as flight durations, Carbon Dioxide emissions and identifying any trends which can be depicted from the analysis. The investigation in to the dataset will be from a csv file containing flight details from various countries, with their corresponding airlines, dates, flight duration, and number of stops, with other parameters available to be measured. The extraction of the das will be conducted with the state of the art programming languages, with particular focus on utilising Pandas for data cleaning, Python which will be used for connecting with the database software, DBeaver, which in the end will all be brought together using Streamlit for data visualisation.

##Tech Stack

- Pandas (Data Transformation)
- Python (Environment set up)
- DBeaver - PostgreSQL (Data analysis and gaining insights)
- Streamlit (Application development for key insights)

#Epics and User Stories 

##Epic 1 

As a Environment Data Analyst, I want to extract the Flights data from the CSV file, so that I can enrich the data accordingly.

##User story 1

As a Data Analyst, I want to extract the CSV file using Pandas so that I can transform and compile this for further analysis.

##Epic 2

As a Environment Data Analyst, I want to standerdise, enrich, clean, convert the data, so that it is ready to be used when ready to load.

##User story 2

As a Environment Data Analyst, I want to clean, remove, add, and seperate columns to have consistency and better readibility.

##User Story 3

As a Environment Data Analyst, I want to remove duplicates, rows with any missing value(s), so that the analysis can be conducted with margin for errors.

##Epic 3

As a Environment Data Analyst, I want to run the ETL pipeline to simultaneously run my VS Code with the PostreSQL database, so that analysis on flight metrics can be measured.

##User Story 4

As a Environment Data Analyst, I want to store the transformed CSF file, cleaned and readily available as a single table in PostreSQL, so that queries can be written to one table only.

##Epic 4

As a Data Analyst, I want to gain insights and rends in the data, so that I can draw relevant conclusions that highlight trends and help take further actions.

##User Story 5

As a Business owner, I want to see the data on pricing, flexibility of airlines, so that I can depict what can be done to enhance flexibility of routes to take.

##User story 6

As a customer, I want to be able to see the price of flights, how long flights are, and how many stops are on this journey, so that I can make better decisions for when I travel.






As a customer (traveler),



As a customer, I want to filter flights by destination country and date range so I see only relevant options with quick indicators of price and duration.
