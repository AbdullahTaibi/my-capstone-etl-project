The investigation in to the dataset will be from a csv file containing flight details from various countries, with their corresponding airlines, dates, flight duration, and number of stops, with other parameters available to be measured. The extraction of the das will be conducted with the state of the art programming languages, with particular focus on utilising Pandas for data cleaning, Python which will be used for connecting with the database software, DBeaver, which in the end will all be brought together using Streamlit for data visualisation.
